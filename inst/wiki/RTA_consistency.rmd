Two algorithms are available to calculate the reflection, transmission and absorption characteristics of a multilayer. Here we check the consistency of the results, using both the R and c++ implementations.

#### Setting up

```{r setup, results='hide'}
```
Simulation of the optical response of a thin gold film sandwiched between glass and water, with incidence at 20 degrees.
