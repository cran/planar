Applying optical reciprocity to the problem of dipolar emission near a planar interface, we can obtain the radiation pattern (intensity vs angle) by modelling the near-field at the dipole location for plane-wave illumination at a range of incident angles.

### Dipole in a vacuum

We first confirm that the dipolar emission in a vacuum follows the expected `sin^2` pattern. We define a dummy simulation (no actual interface),

### Dipole near a thin gold film (Kretschmann configuration)

In the Kretschmann configuration, molecules situated on the air side will radiate predominantly in a narrow cone of angles, associated with the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) radiating into the glass substrate. By reciprocity, the field enhancement experienced by a dipole near the metal layer is also obtained for a narrow range of angles where conservation of in-plane momentum between the incident light and the SPPs is satisfied.
