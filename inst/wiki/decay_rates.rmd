A dipole is placed near a semi-infinite air/metal interface with orientation either parallel or perpendicular to the interface.

```{r load, echo=FALSE,results='hide', message=FALSE}

#### Setting up

```{r setup, results='hide'}
```

Reproducing Fig. 6.1, p. 304 from Principles of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.

```

The total decay rates peak at the wavelength of excitation of planar SPPs ($\varepsilon=-1$) at the interface, they represent a non-radiative loss channel. The radiative decay rate in the upper medium has a trough at the wavelength where $\varepsilon=0$ ($D=0$ in the metal, by continuity $En=0$ above the interface), therefore by virtue of reciprocity the perpendicular dipole will not emit.
