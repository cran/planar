The internal electric field can be calculated with two different codes; here we check that the results are consistent.

Simulation of the optical response of a thin gold film deposited onto a Bragg mirror, with incidence at 5 degrees and p-polarisation. The sum of $M_{par}$ and $M_{perp}$ gives $\left|\mathbf{E}\right|^2$
