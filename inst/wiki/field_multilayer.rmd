#### Setting up

```{r setup, results='hide'}
```

We simulate a thin metal layer sandwiched between glass (incident medium) and air, illuminated from the glass side under p-polarisation, at 44 degrees (Kretschmann configuration). The electric field is normalised by the permittivity of each layer to exemplify the continuity of electric displacement (squared, here) across interfaces.

```{r simulation}
```
A strong electric field can be noted, particularly for the perpendicular component, which decays exponentially from the metal-air interface: this is characteristic of the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons.
